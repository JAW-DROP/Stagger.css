By adding, for example, 'animated slideIn _1' etc to your classes, the elements will stagger into view. You can tweak the LESS file to use different intervals or variables:\r\n\r\nThese 3 elements will stagger and slide into view one at a time.\r\n<div class=\"animated slideIn _1\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"animated slideIn _2\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"animated slideIn _3\"></div>\r\n\r\nView a demo here: http://jsbin.com/cusuz/4\r\n\r\n### How to use\r\nAnimate.css requires animated elements to have classes, \"animated animationName\". All you need to do is add _X example: \"animated slideUp _4\" will delay the animation by 4 * the interval set before firing off the animation.\r\n\r\n### Follow me for updates and other info\r\nIf you like it, please give me a shout at https://twitter.com/uxnoah .
